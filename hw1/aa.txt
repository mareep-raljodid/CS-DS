Moby Dick
Herman Melville
Contents:
Call me Ishmael. Some years ago- never mind how long precisely-having little or no money in my purse, and nothing particular tointerest me on shore, I thought I would sail about a little and seethe watery part of the world. It is a way I have of driving off thespleen and regulating the circulation. Whenever I find myself growinggrim about the mouth; whenever it is a damp, drizzly November in mysoul; whenever I find myself involuntarily pausing before coffinwarehouses, and bringing up the rear of every funeral I meet; andespecially whenever my hypos get such an upper hand of me, that itrequires a strong moral principle to prevent me from deliberatelystepping into the street, and methodically knocking people's hatsoff- then, I account it high time to get to sea as soon as Ican. This is my substitute for pistol and ball. With a philosophicalflourish Cato throws himself upon his sword; I quietly take to theship. There is nothing surprising in this. If they but knew it,almost all men in their degree, some time or other, cherish verynearly the same feelings towards the ocean with me.
